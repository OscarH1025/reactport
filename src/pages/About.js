                    Hello, I am Oscar Hurtado.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Iâ€™m an fullstack bootcamp student. 
                    <br/> 
                    <br/>   
                    I'm twenty years old I'm currently doing two different careers at the same time as I'm attending a coding Bootcamp and getting a degree in Nursing. My passion for programming began during senior year of high school when I took an intro CS course to fulfill a math credit that I needed to graduate. To my surprise, I found that I enjoyed coding and now I'm working to sharp my skills.
